VSI is a cutting-edge, real-time AI system that combines face tracking, speech recognition, interactive visualization, and instant knowledge retrieval.

Each person detected by the camera is assigned a unique ID, allowing the system to track who is speaking.

Spoken sentences are automatically processed, and concise Wikipedia summaries are retrieved in real-time.

An interactive Streamlit dashboard displays the camera feed, tracked IDs, spoken history, AI-generated responses, and visualizations of activity per person.

VSI is perfect for AI demonstrations, educational experiments, and interactive learning, showcasing the integration of computer vision, natural language processing, and real-time data visualization in one seamless system.
